If you are new to markdown, here is a frew online editor [https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html](https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html)

Quick start on formatting is [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). It uses MarkDown, like Discord does.
