This system will help teams by:
- Helping them catch issues before they are a scandal.
- Teams will have some cover is a rider does get caught cheating.
- Help teams verify riders both within there team and on other teams
This will help racers by:
- Racing wil be more fare.
- Racers will want to join teams to become "verified"
