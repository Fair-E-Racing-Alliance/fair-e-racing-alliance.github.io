## Welcome to all teams and members of the Fair-E-Racing Alliance (FERA).
I created this project a week ago to start an initiative to make e-racing on Zwift fairer. I think that Zwift currently has little interest in banning riders at the community level, as they are paying customers. 
One of FERA's goals is to convince as many teams as possible that fair competition from their own riders can reduce this problem. To do this, we want to provide participating teams with tools, procedures and structures that support this effort.
One principle should be to improve competition by controlling our own riders.

- How do we deal with teams that do this professionally?
- How do we deal with teams that have sponsors and are therefore committed to success?
- Dealing with teams that already have banned riders?
- How do we make sure everyone has the same goals?
- Admission only on recommendation of already existing members?
- Do we need a questionnaire to get to know teams and goals better?
